NAME
    Proc::PidUtil - PID file management utilities

SYNOPSIS
      use Proc::PidUtil qw(
            if_run_exit
            is_running
            make_pidfile
            zap_pidfile
            get_script_name
            :all
      );

DESCRIPTION
    Proc::PidUtil provides utilities to manage PID files

    * $rv = if_run_exit('path',$message);
      This routine checks for a file named:

        '(scriptname).pid

      in the the $path directory. If a file is found and the PID found in
      the file is currently a running job, there is no return, the
      subroutine prints the (scriptname): $pid, $message to STDERR and
      exits.

      If there is no file or the PID does not match a running job, run_exit
      returns true.

        input:        path for pidfiles
        return:       true if not running
                      else exits

      Note: also exits if $path is false

    * $rv = is_running('path2pidfile');
      Check that the job described by the pid file is running.

        input:        path 2 pid file
        returns:      pid or false (0) if not running

    * $rv = make_pidfile('path2pidfile',$pid);
      Open a pid file and insert the pid value.

        input:        path 2 pid file,
                      pid value || $$
        returns:      pid or false (0) on error

    * $rv = zap_pidfile($path);
        input:        path for pidfiles
        returns:      return value of 'unlink'

    * $me = get_script_name();
      This function returns the script name portion of the path found in $0;

        input:        none
        returns:      script name

        i.e.  if the script name is:
        /usr/local/stuff/scripts/sc_admin.pl

        $me = get_script_name();

        returns ('sc_admin.pl')
